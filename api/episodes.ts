      "Daemon dreams that he decapitates a young Rhaenyra, who accused him of treason. Grand Maester Orwyle prepares Alicent an abortifacient tea. He professes ignorance when she asks whom Viserys named as heir. Criston beheads Lord Gunthor Darklyn of Duskendale, who refused allegiance. Alys Rivers tells Daemon that Harrenhal is haunted. Her sleep potion causes him to hallucinate seeing his deceased wife, Laena Velaryon. Rhaenyra returns to Dragonstone and agrees to a war using dragons. Rhaenys volunteers herself and her dragon, Meleys. Aegon complains about Aemond and Criston planning battles without him but Alicent dismisses this, saying he, lacking wisdom and knowledge, is inferior to Viserys as a king. She advises he serve the realm by doing nothing and defer to his advisors. Frustrated and drunk, Aegon flies his dragon, Sunfyre, to Rook's Rest. Rhaenys on Meleys burns Criston's troops while Aemond and Vhagar wait to ambush her. When Aegon and Sunfyre approach, Aemond delays attacking. As Meleys mauls Sunfyre, Aemond flies in and has Vhagar burn both dragons. Sunfyre falls with Aegon. Rhaenys and Meleys attack Vhagar, who also falls. As Rhaenys circles above, Vhagar suddenly rises and fatally throttles Meleys, plunging Rhaenys to her death. Criston awakens and finds Aemond with his sword drawn near Aegon, who lies motionless next to the heavily wounded Sunfyre.",

    title: "Regent",
    synopsis:
      "Corlys, Rhaenyra and Baela mourn Rhaenys' death. Criston parades Meleys' head through King's Landing, though the near-starving smallfolk consider it a bad omen. Aegon has survived but is comatose and severely burned, while Sunfyre is near-dead; Criston withholds telling Alicent what truly happened at the battle. Daemon dreams of incest with his mother, who calls him her favorite son. The Small Council reject Alicent's bid as regent and elect Aemond, because he is male and they want a dragonrider on the throne. Aemond orders the city gates shut, preventing blacksmith Hugh Hammer and his family from fleeing. Jeyne Arryn tells Rhaena she is disappointed by Rhaenyra sending two hatchlings rather than a mature dragon. At the Twins, Jace obtains the Freys' allegiance in exchange for Harrenhal. Rhaenyra sends Elinda to King's Landing as a spy. Daemon declares he will reign as king once a large enough army is raised; he orders the Blackwoods to ravage the Brackens and forces their fealty. Alys criticizes Daemon's ruthlessness and the riverlords denounce his atrocities. Rhaenyra laments lacking riders for Vermithor and Silverwing, the only dragons large enough to challenge Vhagar; Jace suggests searching other noble houses for Valyrian descendants.",

      "Jason Lannister leads his army to the Golden Tooth. Aemond refuses vassal Humfrey Lefford's request to fly there and provide support. Aemond wants Tyland Lannister to ally with the Triarchy to break the Velaryon blockade. Aemond orders Criston to march on Harrenhal and dismisses Alicent from the Small Council. Ser Steffon Darklyn, a distant Targaryen descendant, attempts to claim Seasmoke and is incinerated. Daemon continues having disturbing dreams and irrationally believes he is being poisoned. Aemond orders Larys to summon Otto Hightower to court. Aegon, slowly recovering, tells Aemond he remembers nothing about the battle. Gwayne Hightower assures Alicent that her youngest son, Daeron, is kind, unlike his brothers. Corlys appoints his illegitimate son, Alyn of Hull, his flagship's first mate. Meanwhile, Alyn's brother, Addam, is pursued by Seasmoke. Mysaria's spies spread rumors that the royals regularly feast while smallfolk starve. Mysaria sends food-laden Targaryen boats to King's Landing. The grateful citizens fight over limited supplies, causing a riot that Alicent and Helaena barely survive. Mysaria tells Rhaenyra that her father sexually abused her and why she is loyal. They passionately kiss. Upon hearing Seasmoke has a new rider, Rhaenyra leaves on Syrax to confront them.",

    title: "The Red Sowing",
    synopsis:
      "Rhaenyra confronts Addam of Hull, Seasmoke's new rider, who pledges fealty to her. Dismayed at being removed from the Small Council, Alicent retreats to the Kingswood. Larys pushes Grand Maester Orwyle to accelerate Aegon's recovery. While departing the Eyrie with the young princes, Rhaena leaves to find the wild dragon. Mysaria tells Rhaenyra to search for Targaryen dragonseeds (bastards with Valyrian blood) in King's Landing as potential dragonriders. The new Lord Paramount, Oscar Tully, offers Daemon allegiance but denounces his nefarious behavior. He demands Daemon's contrition and to mete out justice for allowing war atrocities; Daemon then executes Willem Blackwood for slaughtering the Brackens. Daemon has another vision of Viserys, who asks if he truly wants the crown and its burden. Jace confronts Rhaenyra, arguing that bastard dragonriders could challenge the Targaryens' power and threaten the succession due to his own illegitimate birth. At Rhaenyra's command, Elinda and Alyn deliver the dragonseeds to Dragonstone, Hugh and Ulf among them. Vermithor kills many dragonseeds until Hugh claims him; meanwhile, Ulf claims Silverwing and flies over King's Landing. Aemond pursues him on Vhagar but nearing Dragonstone, he quickly retreats upon seeing Rhaenyra with Syrax, Vermithor, and Silverwing.",
